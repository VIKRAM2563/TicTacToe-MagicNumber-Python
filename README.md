# Tic Tac Toe with Magic Number

## Overview

This project implements a Tic Tac Toe game in Python, where players use a 3x3 grid to place their marks (X or O). The game determines the winner based on achieving a specific "magic number" sum of 15 across rows, columns, or diagonals.

## Magic Number Concept

In this game:
- X is represented by 1.
- O is represented by -1.
- The magic number for win condition is 15.

When a player achieves a sum of 15 (or -15 for the opponent) across any row, column, or diagonal, they win the game.

## Features

- Interactive console-based gameplay.
- Magic number determines win conditions.
- Clear instructions guide players through the game.

## Gameplay

- Players alternate turns entering their moves.
- Enter row and column coordinates (e.g., "1,2" for the first row, second column).
- The first player to achieve the magic number sum of 15 in any row, column, or diagonal wins.
- The game ends in a draw if the board fills up without achieving the magic number.
